			<div style="">
			<p class="largeFont">The Annual <abbr style="color: red" title="Organic Country Farmer's">OCF</abbr> Market is an event that takes place once a year where farmers nationwide come to <span style="color: blue">Farmerville</span> to show off their products, represent their region, and provide knowledge to customers about where their food comes from. The first Market began in 1962 when April and Gary Livingstone invited all the local farmers to come together to trade produce. Slowly, the event grew and farmers from nearby regions came to Farmerville to display and share their produce. Today, the Annual <abbr style="color:red;" title="Organic Country Farmer's">OCF</abbr> Market has it all, from small local farmers with years of knowledge to internationally renowned farmers who have made themselves a household name. If you are interested in hosting a stall in the next market, please go to <a href="http://www.nswfarmers.org.au/">http://www.nswfarmers.org.au/</a> to fill out the "host a stall" form and join us next year!
